texto = Your smile is so radiant; That it made my heart happy; Give me your hand to escape this terrible darkness; Since the day I found you again; I remembered that beautiful place; That in my childhood was special to me; I want to know if you want to come dance with me; If you give me your hand I will take you; Through a path full of shadows and light
